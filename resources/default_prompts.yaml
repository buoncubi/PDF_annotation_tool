Prompt for Images: |
  # General Instructions

  Help me describe the screenshot (i.e., the attached image), which was extracted from a PDF.

  Write a caption for the screenshot that is:
    - very concise;
    - never redundant with respect to the information contained in this prompt;
    - exhaustive with regard to the information that can be inferred from the image. The caption must include all the `TEXT` that appears in the image (also reported below) in complete sentences that describe its meaning. However, text that appears in the image but does not make sense should be considered a copy-and-paste error from the PDF and therefore discarded.
    - at the beginning of the caption, introduce an extremely brief sentence that names (1) the product (deducible from the `CONTEXT` and from the tree of `SECTIONS` available below) and (2) the type of image (e.g.: installation photo, product photo, technical diagram, installation diagram, textual module, etc.).

  Your goal is to generate a caption in Italian that is effective for retrieving information from this image within a RAG architecture.
  Note that the caption will be contextualized with the information reported below; and these must not be redundant.
  The contextualization is based on the texts of the screenshots adjacent to the one currently being analyzed.

  Write only the caption, so that I can copy and paste it into my DB; do not add anything else.


  # Data related to the attached screenshot to be analyzed

  ## TEXT of the screenshot:
  ```{{text}}```.

  ## Tree of SECTIONS (separated by `>`) in which the screenshot appears:
  ```{{title_path}}````.

  ## CONTEXT of the screenshot:
  ```{{context}}```.


Prompt for Tables: |
  # General Instructions

  Help me describe a table extracted from the PDF catalog.
  To do this, use the text from the table that has been copy-pasted (therefore with possible formatting errors) and the screenshot of the PDF that are attached below.

  Write two paragraphs, without formatting:
  1. A caption of the table, which is:
      - very concise;
      - never redundant with respect to the information contained in this prompt;
      - exhaustive with regard to the information that can be inferred from the table.
      - at the beginning of the caption, introduce an extremely brief sentence that names the product (deducible from the `CONTEXT` and from the tree of `SECTIONS` available below).
  2. Add a paragraph that reports all the data contained in the table in JSON format, repeating (where necessary) the headers of columns, rows, sub-columns, sub-rows, etc. To do this, use the `TEXT` reported below and the attached screenshot.

  The generated text must be in Italian, and effective for retrieving information from this table within a RAG architecture.
  Note that the text you will write will be contextualized with the information reported below; and these must not be redundant.
  The contextualization is based on the texts of the screenshots adjacent to the one currently being analyzed.

  Write only the caption and the table, so that I can copy and paste them into my DB; do not add anything else.


  # Data related to the table to be analyzed (attached screenshot)

  ## TEXT of the table:
  ```{{text}}```.

  ## Tree of SECTIONS (separated by `>`) in which the screenshot appears:
  ```{{title_path}}```.

  ## CONTEXT of the screenshot:
  ```{{context}}```.
